## Manual Deploys

The website automatically deploys to staging and production from the Travis-CI
build, so normally you don't need to deploy anything manually.

### Building/Deploying to STAGING:

*Note:* When Travis-CI builds the `develop` branch, it will automatically deploy
the code to `staging-www.sharesight.com` after any successful build. The
instructions below are just for those cases when you want to manually deploy.

Make sure you've modified your configuration settings (as described below) before proceeding with deploying to staging or production.

		git checkout develop
		git pull origin develop
		APP_ENV=staging bundle exec middleman build
		APP_ENV=staging bundle exec middleman s3_sync

### Building/Deploying to PRODUCTION:

*Note:* When Travis-CI builds the `master` branch, it will automatically deploy
the code to `www.sharesight.com` after any successful build. The
instructions below are just for those cases when you want to manually deploy.

Make sure you've modified your configuration settings (as described below) before proceeding with deploying to staging or production.

		git checkout master
		git pull origin master
		APP_ENV=production bundle exec middleman build
		APP_ENV=production bundle exec middleman s3_sync

## How to add a new Locale

0. Use proper language and country codes – there's a reason why UK is GB.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
1. Open `data/locales.json` and copy one of the existing locales.  *The first locale is the default: global*
 	Ensure to maintain capitalization – the `id` field should be lowercased.
2. Create the file `plans/[country_id].json`. Every plan defaults from `plans/[default_locale_id].json` (via merge), so only overrides need to be in the country plans file.
3. Ensure the Helpsite and Marketing site have the same locales!  Else you will link to a non-existent locale.

Do note, the default_locale_id is set in config.rb.

## How to change the redirection rules on Amazon S3

  1. Change the XML source file

        # for production
        s3/www.sharesight.com_redirection_rules.xml

        # for staging
        s3/staging-www.sharesight.com_redirection_rules.xml

  2. Commit and push your changes
  3. Copy the content of the file to the
  [production bucket properties](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-1#&bucket=middleman-www&prefix=)
  or
  [staging bucket properties](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-1#&bucket=staging-middleman-www&prefix=)
  on AWS

    using `Properties`, then `Static Website Hosting`, and finally paste
    them into the textarea

    ![bucket properties](s3/bucket_properties.png)

    and press the `Save` button.


## Testing Holes

	1. Extensions are not tested.
	2. The logic in the config file is not tested.
