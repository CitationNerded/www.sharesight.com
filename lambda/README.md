# Cloudfront + Lambda for localization

## WARNING
#### AWS May change!
 - The version of Node AWS offers currently (v6.10) is no longer in LTS.
 - Their UI has changed and may continue to change, these instructions may become out of date quickly.
 - As of current writing, some of the Examples and screenshots in their own documentation are incorrect and do not match reality.
 - Lambdas are pretty young.  Lambda + Cloudfront is only out of preview in the past 6 months and the origin request type we're using is even newer than that.

## Why
  - We want to serve users their localized content.

## Tests
  - Run `yarn jest`.

## Deployment
  - Always run these steps on the `develop` branch.  There could be multiple testing versions of this lambda file around and you should always work with the merged copy, not your own copy, when modifying staging.
  - Test code changes first via `yarn jest` and improve `./localizationLambda.jest.js` whenever you make changes!
  - Visit the [Lambda](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions/localizeMarketingSiteCloudfrontRequests/versions/$LATEST)
  - Paste the contents of `./localizationLambda.js` into the code section of `$LATEST`.
  - Under `Actions`, select `Publish a New Version`.  Cloudfront can only run versioned Lambdas, not aliased or $LATEST.
  - On the newly published version, drag the Cloudfront trigger onto the Lambda actions/triggers section.  This means "when Cloudfront does something, do this Lambda".
  - Example Trigger: distributionId: E1LG497M3L1WGH, cacheBehavior: \*, event: Origin Request
  - Alternatively, go into the Cloudfront Endpoint > Behavior Tab > Select the Behavior (eg. \*), and at the bottom of the page, change or set the version of the Lambda for *Origin Request* to match the version you just published.
  - Invalidate everything, if necessary via Invalidations Tab: `/*`...
  - NOTE: You can assign different version to different Cloudfront Endpoints!  So if you're testing a change, you assign version [100] to `staging-www.sharesight.com` and keep version [95] to `www.sharesight.com`.

## Caching
  - Cloudfront caches, that's the point.
  - We cache based on `sharesight_country` cookie + `cloudfront-viewer-country` header.
  - This means that when someone visits `/nz/faq`, Cloudfront looks to see if a user with countryHeader=NZ and countryCookie=CA has been cached.
    - If so, it would respond with the cached response, which is the 302 previously created by this Lambda – `302 Found => /ca/faq/`.
    - If not, it would run through the Lambda, return a response (`302 Found => /ca/faq/`) and cache that response for future visits.
    - NOTE: This means we have a lot of caches!  Our possible cache set is `countries * (supported_countries + 1)`.  As we add more locales, this gets bigger.
    - Luckily, most of our users are from the same places.  It's not really an issue.  Even if it was an issue, Cloudfront can handle this.

## Known Issues
  - If a page does not exist in a locale (eg. there is no /ca/page and you visit a valid /nz/page), the user will get a 404 (yet the link itself would not have 404'd).
