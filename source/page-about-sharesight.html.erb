      <h2 class="heading_paragraph heading_light">
        My son Scott Ryburn and I evolved the idea for <a href="<%= localize_url(locale_id: locale_obj[:id]) %>">Sharesight</a> over 2006 and 2007. By then I had spent nearly 10 years as a keen, but highly frustrated, self-directed investor.
      </h2>
      <p>Recordkeeping was a nightmare and working out the true performance of my portfolio so that I knew whether it was worth all the drama, was nearly impossible.</p>

      <p>We began our journey by bringing on board two highly experienced software developers as founding shareholders, which gave us the technical backing to bring our ideas to reality.</p>

      <p>From there, Sharesight developed a unique and innovative product, including sophisticated corporate action processing â€“ the first of its kind for a product that was accessible to self-directed investors.</p>

      <p>Developing Sharesight as a web based offering provided a cost effective channel to make it available online to everyone. We signed up our first paying customer in April 2008.</p>

      <p>Fast forward to today and we have built up a great team around us. Scott as our CTO manages a team of dedicated developers in Wellington and Doug Morris as CEO has assumed overall management of Sharesight and the committed, enthusiastic team in our Sydney office.</p>

      <p>In addition to self-directed investors, we now count financial advisors, fund managers, and accountants as clients. We've also developed ways for partner companies to leverage our portfolio technology to power their own solutions.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, the best way to understand what Sharesight is all about is to <a href="<%= config[:signup_url] %>" title="Sign up for Sharesight">sign up and try it for yourself</a>. We're confident that you'll agree that it's the best portfolio tracking system available today.</p>
